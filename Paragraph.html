        GitHub is a platform for hosting, sharing, and collaborating on software projects. It is built around Git, a version control system that helps developers track changes to code over time and collaborate with others. GitHub adds several features on top
        of Git to facilitate collaboration, such as issue tracking, pull requests, and project management tools.
